# code-samples
Part of a semester project I worked on. 

The input data are thermal sequences, ie. time series of temperature measurements, taken during the execution of various tasks (Task 1,2,3, ..) on a smartphone.


The goal of the model is to identify which task is being executed at any given time, based on these thermal measurements.
